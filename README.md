# Overview
Ok now that is out of the way, let me tell you a story. Naive me a couple years ago bought Microsoft Office 2016 standalone for 60 USD from a retailer named "BongoRolls" on Amazon. ![l](../main/ReadMe Reference Images/Wasted 60 dollars.PNG)
I was emailed the virtual disk image and the activation key. After installing office, I just let it sit there for a while, since I hadn't had a use for it during said 2 weeks. When I finally needed to use Excel and Powerpoint, I put the key in and guess what?
No work ðŸ˜”. SOOOO I did what any reasonable person would do, and messaged the seller... waited for another week... and no reply. Okay, time to leave a review on the product to warn other users... the product was taken down ðŸ™„. Fine! I'll review the seller then! Oop, apparently "I had not ordered anything from said seller"(product was taken down). I messaged them again, and in stronger words this time, but to this day, I still have not recieved any form of reply.
