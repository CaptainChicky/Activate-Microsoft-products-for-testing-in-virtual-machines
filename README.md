# NOT DONE YET SO PLEASE WAIT

# DISCLAIMER!!!
<sub>Unfortunately, since this could actually get me into legal trouble, I have to include this at the top :/<sub>
  
Everything here in this repository is for ***educational purposes only***, with the usage of such tools ***only*** intended for **testing** software or of the like *inside virtual machines*. I do **NOT** enourage people to pirate windows, or **any** of Microsoft's software, as a matter of fact. **NEVER** use this as a way to activate windows on a real computer, or a way to ilegally obtain free software. **Buy the key!**

# Story time :)
Ok now that is out of the way, let me tell you a story. Naive me a couple years ago bought Microsoft Office 2016 standalone for 60 USD from a retailer named "BongoRolls" on Amazon.

I was emailed the virtual disk image and the activation key. After installing office, I just let it sit there for a while, since I hadn't had a use for it during said 2 weeks. When I finally needed to use Excel and Powerpoint, I put the key in and guess what?
No work ðŸ˜”. SOOOO I did what any reasonable person would do, and messaged the seller... waited for another week... and no reply. 

Okay, time to leave a review on the product to warn other users... the product was taken down ðŸ™„. Fine! I'll review the seller then! Oop, apparently "I had not ordered anything from said seller"(product was taken down) ðŸ‘º. I messaged them again, and in stronger words this time, but to this day, I still have not recieved any form of reply. I decided to get a refund, but after clicking on that button, apparently I had waited too long, and that my order was not eligible for one. What a joke! 

So therefore, I went on the internet and searched for a solution, and found the autoKMS method, which worked perfectly. I have subsequently experimented with the activation methods for most Microsoft software, and found ways to activate them.

Also yes, at that time, I thought about but didn't bother contacting Microsoft, and now, I doubt Microsoft would have done anything. Today, the order is still on the way. Just a wee bit too late though, as you can obviously see...

# Overview...
In the repository, you can find tools to activate the following software ***for testing in virtual machines***, of course, which are, but **may be not limited to**:
  1) Windows 95 OSR 2 x86
  2) Windows 98 SE x86
  3) Windows XP SP3 Professional Corporate x64 and Professional x86
  4) Windows Vista Home Premium SP2 x86 and x64
  5) Windows 7 Ultimate x64
  6) Windows 8/8.1 Professional x64
  7) Windows 10 Professional x64
  8) Microsoft Office 2016
  9) Microsoft Office 2019
  10) Windows Server 2016(Datacenter, Essentials, Standard)
  11) Windows Server 2019(Datacenter, Essentials, Standard)

*Why the "may be not limited to"?* Well that's because these versions are either what I have installed in virtual machines and thus can confirm they work, or have seen them work when used by other people. However, since these tools are intended for a wide array of software versions, they will most likely work on other versions of said software as well.
  
# What about the virtual disk image files or media creation tools to install these?
Unfortunately, I do not have a collection of all of them, and as a result, the repository collection of these will be incomplete. One would need to surf the internet or ask a forum like reddit for such files that are missing from here.

# In-depth explanation for each of the tools included...
