#   1   -   Recovery
##########################################################################
Is Windows failing to boot after you installed the loader? Just do the following.

* Boot up the PC from your Windows installation disk
* Press and hold SHIFT and then press F10
* Input "bootsect.exe /nt60 SYS /force" (without quotes)
* Restart the PC

Note: If the above doesn't fix your boot issue then use the command "bootsect.exe /nt60 ALL /force" instead. Just make sure you remove all USB flash drives before you use the command.

Alternatively try holding the 'R' key after your BIOS screen. If you time it right then you'll see a boot menu. From the menu select to boot without a SLIC.



##########################################################################
#   2   -   Genuine status
##########################################################################
Have you installed the loader but you're not genuine? Just check the following.

* Check the details line contains "v2.1", "v2.2" or "v2.3"
* Try to validate online with Internet Explorer at http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/

Note: If the details line doesn't read v2.1, v2.2 or v2.3 then go to the advanced tab, select to disable type 4 memory and reinstall the loader. If that doesn't work then use the legacy setting instead.

#   3   -   Questions and answers
##########################################################################
Q. The loaders status says "Modified - Uninstall other cracks", what do I do?
A. You can either find a way to uninstall the other cracks, download WAT Fix or format. http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/26994

Q. Why did I lose activation after I allowed Windows to run startup repair?
A. Startup repair will write a new boot sector. To prevent this use the following command from command prompt as an administrator "bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreshutdownfailures"

Q. I dual boot with Windows 8 and the loaders not working for me, so how do I fix it?
A. Boot to Windows 8 and enter the following command from command prompt as an administrator "bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy"

Q. I installed the loader and I'm still not activated, so what do I do now?
A. Go to the loaders advanced options tab and select to either either disable type 4 memory or use the legacy setting, then press install and reboot when prompted. You may also need to select the option to ignore the systems existing SLIC and/or revalidate online.

Q. The loaders status says "Unsupported partition table", why is this?
A. You're either using GPT on a UEFI motherboard or you've got a locked OEM partition. Both problems can be fixed by fully formatting your entire hard drive.

Q. I received the error message "Error finding your systems active partition", what do I have to do?
A. You need to format the whole hard drive with a program like Active@ Kill Disk. This issue is caused by your locked OEM partition. http://software.lsoft.net/boot-cd-iso.zip

Q. I received the error message "Failed to add loader to the boot code", what do I have to do?
A. Disable any system protection. Some types of software block the loader application from installing to the boot code.

Q. I've used a version of the loader before and it failed to work, what do I have to do?
A. If you previously used bootsect to get back into Windows then you first need to press uninstall, reboot and then install the newest version of the loader.

Q. I've previously used another activation solution and I think it's modified my systems files, can I fix it?
A. You can first try to uninstall what you originally installed and then try running "sfc.exe /scannow" from command prompt as an administrator.

Q. I lose activation status after my systems been to sleep or has been in hibernation, can I fix it?
A. Go to the advanced options and select to disable type 4 memory, install the loader again and see if that cures it. If you're not cured try to disable type 3 memory instead. If it still fails try selecting the legacy setting.

Q. I installed the loader and my system hangs during the boot process, can I fix it?
A. Go to the advanced options and select to disable type 4 memory, install the loader again and see if that cures it. If you're not cured try to disable type 3 memory instead. If it still fails try selecting the legacy setting.

Q. I installed the loader and rebooted but I'm not activated. The loader application displays the message "BAD SLIC SIZE" or "BAD SLIC DATA", can I fix it?
A. Uninstall the loader, power down and then boot up the system again. Go to the applications advanced options and select to ignore the existing SLIC and then press install and reboot when prompted.

Q. My systems UEFI, but I've formatted the drive to use MBR and I'm still not activated. What do I do?
A. Check your UEFI menu for secure boot and make sure it's disabled.

The loader doesn't work when the systems using GPT. The workaround is to pre-format your hard drive so that it uses MBR instead.

From your BIOS select to boot the Windows DVD without UEFI, press and hold SHIFT and then press F10 and then enter this:

diskpart
list disk
select disk 0
clean
convert mbr
create partition primary
select partition 1
format fs=ntfs quick

Boot the Windows DVD the same way you did the first time and then continue with the installation of Windows. Once complete you can then install the loader.

To forcefully boot Windows 7 without UEFI you can use the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool. Once the USB is created just delete bootmgr.efi from the USB and then try to boot from it.

#   5   -   Server 2012 (R2) compatibility
##########################################################################
Starting with the Server 2012 range Microsoft requires the RSDP to be in read only memory. Because of this there are limitations.


* Systems with an existing SLIC in their BIOS should have success
* Systems with an Intel CPU may have success due to chipset lock picking
* Systems with an AMD CPU may struggle to gain activation status if they don't have an existing SLIC in their BIOS
* If the loaders details line contains "v2.3" or "v2.2" but your systems not activated then your systems probably not compatible

======
To convert Windows Server 2012 from an evaluation edition you must use the following command:

DISM /online /Set-Edition:<edition ID> /ProductKey:XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX /AcceptEula

Here's two examples:

DISM /online /Set-Edition:ServerDatacenter /ProductKey:B7RRX-RVN4P-PCPBM-89D8Y-X4PQH /AcceptEula
DISM /online /Set-Edition:ServerStandard /ProductKey:VDNYM-JBKJ7-DC4X9-BT3QR-JHRGY /AcceptEula

Your system may then need to reboot 2 times before the loader will work.

If a certificate or SLIC is released and I have not put out a new version of my application simply create two folders, one called "Certificates" and another called "SLICs".

In each folder put the files you want to add support for, just be sure you label the files like this:

*Certificates folder*
Acer.XRM-MS
Advent.XRM-MS
Alienware.XRM-MS
Asus.XRM-MS


*SLICs folder*
Acer.BIN
Advent.BIN
Alienware.BIN
Asus.BIN


When using external files all preset internals will be ignored. This is a cleaner approach for users who want to build their own list without my presets getting in the way.
